However, every project is different and often developers will encounter situations where help from BQA is essential. Feature validation. We aim for a process that will ensure that the software delivered by developers is free of bugs.
However, we found that it was still important for BQA to take another look at each story submitted. In some cases, BQA needs to take responsibility for more demanding testing, for example. run the application on a wider range of devices Perform regression testing.
