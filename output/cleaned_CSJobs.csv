About the Team
Our Transport team is a big family of 100+ members made up of engineers and product managers spread out across Jakarta, Bangalore, Singapore, and Vietnam. We run Southeast Asia’s leading and fastest-growing ride-hailing business and oversee all things related to our riders and driver-partners' needs in daily transport and work daily to create solutions to these issues. It’s our job to ensure that our Transport services run seamlessly from the inside out.
Our team recently figured out that our existing third-party SDK for in-app live tracking of vehicles was not operating as smoothly as we had expected. So, guess what? We fixed this by building our own live tracking SDK - Navic. Right now, our team has been busy working on projects that aim to effectively grow our user base in the region (and beyond!).
We, the Transporters, know how to work hard and play hard. Though working from home has been a significant change, it hasn’t made work boring - in fact, we’ve been enjoying this new work setup more than we expected! When we aren’t busy working, you’d probably find us playing online games like Among Us and Sketchful, or catching up with each other on our virtual hangouts. We work as a team to get our job done well, and genuinely enjoy each other's company.

As the project progresses, BQA monitors quality issues and works to improve the process. In other words, BQA Rangle doesn't just detect bugs and report them to developers for fixing. Instead, it aims to understand why the bug appears and to find a solution to the root cause.
Helps identify possible quality issues in advance and assists in story creation.
Helps developers test their software. Ideally, all bugs would be caught by the respective developers before each feature is shipped, as this allows them to be fixed immediately, without unnecessary communication costs and context switching.
To get closer to this ideal world, we ask our developers to thoroughly test their code and train them to do it efficiently. However, every project is different and often developers will encounter situations where help from BQA is essential. Feature validation. We aim for a process that will ensure that the software delivered by developers is free of bugs.
However, we found that it was still important for BQA to take another look at each story submitted. In some cases, BQA needs to take responsibility for more demanding testing, for example. run the application on a wider range of devices Perform regression testing.
Some amount of regression testing must be performed by the developer after completing each feature, but BQA often takes on the more systematic task of regression testing.
