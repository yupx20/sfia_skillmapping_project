BQA will work with POs to understand project needs and help formulate strategies to achieve the required level of quality, ensuring that strategies are aligned with the delivery process and client needs.
Monitor and continually refine quality strategies.
As the project progresses, BQA monitors quality issues and works to improve the process. In other words, BQA Rangle doesn't just detect bugs and report them to developers for fixing. Instead, it aims to understand why the bug appears and to find a solution to the root cause.
Helps identify possible quality issues in advance and assists in story creation.
Helps developers test their software. Ideally, all bugs would be caught by the respective developers before each feature is shipped, as this allows them to be fixed immediately, without unnecessary communication costs and context switching.
To get closer to this ideal world, we ask our developers to thoroughly test their code and train them to do it efficiently. However, every project is different and often developers will encounter situations where help from BQA is essential. Feature validation. We aim for a process that will ensure that the software delivered by developers is free of bugs.
However, we found that it was still important for BQA to take another look at each story submitted. In some cases, BQA needs to take responsibility for more demanding testing, for example. run the application on a wider range of devices Perform regression testing.
Some amount of regression testing must be performed by the developer after completing each feature, but BQA often takes on the more systematic task of regression testing.
Apart from that, BQA also creates project or application documentation aimed at users and internally.
